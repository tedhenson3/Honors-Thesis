# Recruiting Project #
I am attempting to predict college performance based on recruiting data and high school statistics.
This project is supervised research with Dr. Mario Giaccomazo.
My initial paper will focus only on basketball; however, the code and process will be transferable to other sports such as football.
I am planning on submitting my paper in competitions such as the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference research competition in 2020.
