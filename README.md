# Recruiting Project #
The goal of this project is to predict collegiate basketball performance based on recruiting data and high school statistics.
This project began as supervised research with Dr. Mario Giacomazzo in the spring of 2019 and has evolved into my senior honors thesis. Improvements to the existing paper will come through incorporating AAU statistics, more advanced statistical methods, and eliminating the use of k nearest neighbor imputation.
