# Recruiting Project #
The goal of this project is to predict collegiate basketball performance based on recruiting data and high school statistics.
This project began as supervised research with Dr. Mario Giaccomazo in the spring of 2019 and has evolved into my senior honors thesis. Improvements to the existing paper will come through incorporating AAU statistics and more advanced statistical methods. I am planning on submitting my paper in competitions such as the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference research competition in 2020.
